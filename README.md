About
=====
Outplay Ai is simply a forecasting (time-series predicting) Machine Learning model on React.  

Currently it's just Rock, Paper, Scissors. Please do suggest any other games that you might want to see.
  
It trains on a dataset of your recentmost 10 moves. The first move is always paper since that is how I've initialized the training set.

Ingredients
===========

The app is built using:

*   ReactJS
*   React Bootstrap (for styling)
*   React Router DOM (for front-end routing)
*   Redux Toolkit aka RTK (For state management)
*   BrainJS (for implementing LSTM logic; ML stuff)
